# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
The main goal for this project was to create a web app that can be regularly updated at the press of a button. The web app displays information about the planet Mars that is scraped from various websites, including a NASA website. It also displays pictures of the planet, which are also updated when the data scraping button is pressed. The web app is meant to be mobile-responsive as well.
